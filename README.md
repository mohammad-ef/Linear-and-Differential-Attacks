# Linear and Differential Attacks

A **simple** java programming exercise using linear and Differential cryptanalysis to attack the structures below with four different S-boxes.

|*Structure a*|*Structure b*|


#### Considering the structures above:
1.	Find the top five linear probabilities (biases) for structures a and b.
2.	Find the top five differential probabilities for structures a and b.

#### The S-boxesâ€™ values for the above structures are as follows:
